// Good afternoon, Scott.

// In the scene, you will find an 'InputMgr' game object which has the InputMgr.cs script.
// Feel free to adjust the snap distance.
// If you set 'motionCamera' to 'true,' then this allows the InputMgr.cs script to repeatedly update the robot's arm home position based on the
// camera's current view point.  If the setting is set to 'false,' then it only checks for the home position at the moment the arm is detatched.

// On the upper right arm of the robot, you will find the InteractiveController.cs script.
// This script is designed to be placed on any game object in the scene in which the user can grab and move.
// This script has an enum drop down allowing you to choose from 3 different styles of highlighting.  Please feel free to try them all.
// The individual highlighting style parameters allow you to customize the end visual as desired.
// Additionally, the text in the scene that shows the arm's status is controlled by this script.

// Lastly, on both the upper and lower arm, you'll find a re-compiled version of a Unity store asset known as 'Quick Outline.'
// These merely control the visual look of the outline shader style of highlighting.

// For the Unit Testing, you will find it in the folder Assets > Tests > EditMode > Test_SnapNotZero.cs
// If I understood your instructions correctly, this tests to ensure that all instances of the InputMgr.cs script has a snap distance value above zero.

// I appreciate your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.
